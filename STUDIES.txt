- TARGET:
	- Hardware (to be retrieved from the computer itself) limitation on using math formulas.
		- Standardize and develop a source code library to facilitate this.
			- HW capacities:
				- Virtual CPU
				- Virtual Memory
				- Virtual Persistent Storage
				- Virtual Networks
				- Virtual Screen
				- Virtual Audio
				- Virtual Peripherals
					- Virtual Keyboard
					- Virtual Pointer
				- Virtual Desktop
					- Home Butten (set to any the the OS accepts as default based on URL value)
					- Rolodex Desktops
				- Virtual Subscriptions (pull subscription options from network and select into subscription set)
				- Virtual Library
				- Virtual Flow Designer (select item on screen to add [immutable copy] into Flow Designer)
			- Software capacities:
				- ID Storage
				- Personal Home
				- Tokens
				- Private Sandbox
				- Channels
				- Application
				- Pulled Content
				- Pushed Messages
				- Modes:
					- Programming Mode
					- Business Mode
					- Family Mode
					- Data Input Mode
					- Publishing Mode
				- Backup State Transfer
				- Process Design
				- Public Information
				- Repository
				- User Space
			- Applications:

	- Research Internet:
		- CPU (one or more, one or more cores)
		- RAM (s.t.u.d.y.)
		- HD (one or more, bus-type, HW-type; spinning, SSD, other..)
		- Networking (?)
			- USB

		- Screen
			- One ore more screens at the same time
			- Mirror
			- Desktop (visual across more than one screen)
		- Audio
			- Outputs
				- One or more at the same time
		- Add-Ons
			- CD/DVD Drive
				- Read-Only or Read-Write
			- Memory-slots
